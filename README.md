##  Result and Finding
 ❖ Small-sized stores are more profitable than medium-sized ones.

    generate higher profits than Creative & Arts products.

 ## Recommondations
 - *Focus on Underperforming Store Audits:*
 •Investigate stores opened in 2008, 2014, and 2018 to identify issues causing low profit and sales — optimize 
  operations or consider relocation/closure if needed.
 - *Boost Creative & Arts Product Marketing*
 •Given their high sales volume, increase promotional campaigns and bundle offers around Creative & Arts 
  products to drive even more sales.
 - *Region-Specific Sales Strategies*
 •Tailor marketing, inventory, and staffing for regions with low sales performance, leveraging insights from 
  region-wise sales and customer count KPIs.
 - *Optimize Payment Methods Availability*
 •Adapt payment options in each region based on preferred purchase methods to reduce cart abandonment and 
  increase conversion rates.
 - *Use Time-Based Sales Tracking (YTD/MTD/QTD)*
 •Implement regular reviews of sales trends over different time frames to spot issues early and quickly adjust 
  tactics.
